# ToktersPlayground

My project to learn Avalonia, and being a framework to build various tools/components.

## Paraglider Layout 
Component to draw a parglidedr layout, define attachment points etc. Which then can be used to create a 2D triangulated mesh. Which is meant to be a starting point for a paraglider physics simulation.
